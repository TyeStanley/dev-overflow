## üåê Demo

Here is a working live demo: https://dev-overflow-gray.vercel.app/

## üìù Description

Welcome to Dev Overflow, a dedicated question and answer platform for developers. Here's a brief overview of the project:

- **Motivation**: The motivation behind this project was to create a dedicated platform where developers can ask questions and share knowledge. The aim was to foster a community that helps each other grow.

- **Why I Built This Project**: The main goal was to provide a user-friendly platform where developers can find solutions to their coding problems, share their knowledge, and learn from others.

- **Problem Solved**: Dev Overflow addresses the need for a focused, community-driven platform for developers. It simplifies the process of finding reliable solutions to coding problems, making knowledge sharing more efficient and accessible.

- **What I Learned**: Throughout the development process, I gained valuable insights into community building, full-stack web development, and the importance of clear communication in a technical environment.

- **Future Plans**: I plan to add more features to the platform, such as a job board, a blog, and a newsletter. I also plan to add a feature that allows users to save jobs to their favorites list.
